# Giorgi Gelbakhiani Inspired Landing Page

This project is a visually appealing landing page inspired by the artwork of Giorgi Gelbakhiani. I created it using HTML and CSS. The page has a modern design, with a background image that has an overlay effect, making the text stand out. The layout is responsive, ensuring it appears well on various devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. I also added social media icons using FontAwesome for an interactive touch.
